# DEVSOC Trainee Application 25T3
## Intro
For this application I need to create an perosnal website with the theme "Dream" in mind.
I have decied to use DreamWorks to illustrate this point. Also add sections that depict someone sleeping or dreaming.
Moreover, put some references to some DreamWork characters.

## Deployment
`https://mundanedragon.github.io/DevSocApp_1/`

## Disclaimer
All of the images used in the deployed website was generated by AI, this was to speed up the development of the website.
The idea to include each image and it's positions are my ideas, only the images used where AI generated.
